		<say_ready>When you are ready, simply say 'ready'.</say_ready>
		<help>I am waiting for you to say 'ready', 'next', 'previous', or 'list'</help>
		<next>Ok, I'll do what I can to move things along...</next>
		<previous>Ok, I'll do what I can to back things up...</previous>
		<last_attack>That was the last attack for now. You can rest easy, until next time... (End.)</last_attack>
		<first_attack>You are back to the beginning...</first_attack>
		<getting_shell>Ok. Gaining shell access, and running post command...</getting_shell>
		<got_shell>We are in to your system...</got_shell>
		<repeat>Let me know when you are 'ready', if you want to move on to another attack, say 'next', or 'previous' and I'll move things along</repeat>
